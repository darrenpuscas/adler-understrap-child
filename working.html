  ADLER instructors are all practitioners, bringing their professional experience into the classroom, as well as training in the field. Our objective is to ensure students successfully secure employment or assist them in their goal of developing further in the job they have. We have a compact student body, enabling us to develop individualized courses and training.
  <blockquote class="blockquote">Built on Adlerian values of mutual respect and collaboration, ADLER continues a 40-year tradition of Adlerian education and training in Ontario. Why choose ADLER? Unique amongst private educational institutions, we offer a professional Master of Psychology* degree (with full consent of the Ontario Ministry of Advanced Education and Skills Development) making ours the only such degree in Ontario. A hands-on, applied approach in all our courses and programs.</blockquote>
  We provide the option of taking individual graduate courses to retrain, upgrade, or remediate for registration or certification.
  ADLER programs and courses reflect current professional standards, and our students are informed about the latest changes in legislation or accreditation. We’ve developed weekend and intensive schedules that are ideal for working adults, with a curriculum built on the principles of adult education. *This program is offered under the written consent of the Ontario Minister of Advanced Education and Skills Development for the period from August 8, 2017 to August 7, 2022. Prospective students are responsible for satisfying themselves that the program and the degree will be appropriate to their needs (e.g., acceptable to potential employers, professional licensing bodies or other educational institutions).
